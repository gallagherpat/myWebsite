I am a developer with experience in front end development and game development. My multidisciplinary background gives me a unique insight into the devlopment process. <br> <br> I work with HMTL, CSS, and Javascript. I'm also working a lot in unreal engine and using the blueprints to make exciting new games. <br> <br> Keep an eye out from my latest game in the works Project Ningen! <br> <br> <h3 class="aboutMeHeader">Some more:</h3> <br> I've been in love with games all my life and that love has taken me on an interesting journey. Currently I'm working at GK Software as a developer for the persales team. This job has pushed my skills much further than I expected and I'm ready to push further. <br> <br> I love to learn, I'm always on the look out for something new, I'm in love with the ah-ha moment. I keep my eye out for new problems to overcome and enjoy the process of researching the solution. <br> <br> I'm based in the little big town of Wendell, with my beautiful girlfriend, just outside of Raleigh. We spend time doing our hobbies, exploring the town, or hanging out with friends and family. <br> <br> I really enjoy cooking and maybe if you're lucky you'll get invited to a dinner party ;). I also love collecting records with my fravorite era's of music being the 70's and 80's, and my favorite artist is probably Dan Auerbach. </div> <br> <br> <br> </div> </div> </body></html>
